The game is not working as planned. It is functioning behind the scenes, but I didn't get the UI and button flow working the way I hoped.

I'll fix it this next few days.

Instructions: Type your bet in the input box. Press place bet and then press deal. Choose to hit or stay. Then watch your bank update and wins/losses update.
